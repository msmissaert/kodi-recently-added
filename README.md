## Installation

### Pre-Installation

**NOTE: This component only works with Home Assistant version 0.115 and above. Additionally Kodi must be setup via the UI in the integrations section of the Home Assistant configuration.**

### HACS Install

1. Search for `Kodi next up Component` under `Integrations` in the HACS Store tab.
2. Install the card: [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card)
3. ~~Add the code to your `configuration.yaml` using the config options below. [See Conifuring via YAML](#configuring-via-yaml).~~ (This is deprecated and it's recommended to add the integration via the Home Assistant Integrations if you are using >= v2.0.0. See [Configuring via Integrations](#configuring-via-integrations))
4. Add the code for the card to your `ui-lovelace.yaml`, or via the lovelace dashboard.
5. **You will need to restart after installation for the component to start working.**
6. [Configure](#configuration) your sensor.

### Manual Install

1. In your `/config` directory, create a `custom_components` folder if one does not exist.
2. Copy the [kodi_recently_added](https://github.com/boralyl/kodi-recently-added/tree/master/custom_components) folder and all of it's contents from to your `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. [Configure](#configuration) your sensor.

## Configuration

### Configuring via YAML (Deprecated: See [Configuring via Integrations](#configuring-via-integrations))

| key          | required | default | description                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host         | yes      | --      | The host Kodi is running on. This is the same host that was configured when adding the Kodi integration via the UI. |
The host is the same host you entered when configuring Kodi via the integrations page.

#### Sample configuration.yaml:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: kodi_next_up
    host: 10.1.1.2
  
```

### Configuring via Integrations

1. Navigate to the Integrations page under the Configuration section.
2. Click the button to add a new integration and search for `Kodi next up Media`.
3. Select which instance of Kodi you would like to use and click Submit.
4. 2 entities will automatically be created. One tracks your next up tv shows and
   is named `sensor.kodi_next_up_episodes`. 

An `Options` button will appear on the integration. Clicking this will allow you to
toggle additional options. Currently the only option is whether or not the sensor should
ignore watched media or not. By default it does not.

### Card Configuration

#### Sample for ui-lovelace.yaml:

```yaml
- type: custom:upcoming-media-card
  entity: sensor.kodi_recently_added_tv
  title: next up Episodes
  image_style: fanart

```

## Upgrading from configuration.yaml to UI Integration

1. Remove any sensors in your `configuration.yaml` that reference the `kodi_recently_added`
   platform.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Navigate to the Integrations page under the Configuration section.
4. Click the button to add a new integration and search for `Kodi next up Media`.
5. Select which instance of Kodi you would like to use and click Submit.
6. 2 entities will automatically be created. One tracks your next up tv shows and
   is named `sensor.kodi_recently_added_tv`. The other tracks your next up movies
   and is named `sensor.kodi_recently_added_movies`.

## Known Issues

Below is a list of known issues that either can't be fixed by changes to the component
itself due to external factors.

### Artwork does not load when using the upcoming-media-card

One reason this could occur is if you setup you Home Assistance instance to use SSL and
your Kodi instance does not use SSL. When the upcoming-media-card tries to load the
artwork it will fail to do so since modern browsers do not allow loading insecure requests.
See [#6](https://github.com/boralyl/kodi-recently-added/issues/6) for more details and
possible workarounds.

### Genres, ratings and studios don't show up for TV Shows

Currently genres, rating, and studio are only populated for Movies. This is a limitation
of the data Kodi stores for TV shows.
